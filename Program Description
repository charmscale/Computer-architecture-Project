/* The purpose of this program is to make a game (in this case, Lexathon) entirely in MIPS assembly language. 
The game is a type of word search, where players are tasked to find as many words as possible from a set grid of letters. 
Players are scored for each word they successfully find while a clock ticks down to zero. 
After the timer runs out., the game ends. */

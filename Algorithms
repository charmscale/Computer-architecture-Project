/* 
For my part of the program, I used a simple branch instruction to brach to a label chosen by the player.
The most difficult part of my program was displaying the grid. My approach to this problem was to create an array of all 26
letters of the alphabet. To print the random 3 x 3 grid, I initialized a $t0 counter and used a jump instruction to implement a while loop. 
In the while loop, I used service 42 to generate a random integer between 1 and 26 that would be used to index an element in the char array. Once 
the integer is generated, the element of that index is accessed and printed onto the console. When the counter reaches 3 or 6,
the while loop branches to print a new line and returns to the while loop. When the counter reaches 9,
the while loop ends, thus printing the the 3 x 3 grid.
